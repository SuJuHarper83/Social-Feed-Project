// create the "like" and "dislike" buttons here
// export, and call this component into the Post component

// Lastly, you will need to build out the “like” and “dislike” functionality. 
// Within the “Post” component, create 2 separate functions – one for when the “like” button is clicked, 
// and one for when the “dislike” button is clicked. Bind these functions to their respective button’s onClick event. 
// Within these functions, start to lay out the steps that need to occur when each button is clicked.

// For now, do not worry about the functionality for the “like” and “dislike” buttons 
// just decide where and how you would like them to display on each individual post!

const LikeButtons = () => {
